Portfolio

Vasundhra Dahiya is a PhD scholar in Digital Humanities at IIT Jodhpur. Her research area is Algorithmic Accountability. She comes with the belief that social context is imperative to define ethicalities in data-driven AI systems. Her work aims to bring together the various subjectivities to inculcate better and inclusive practices of designing responsible socio-technical systems. The symbiotic relationship between human experiences and technology calls for a critical inspection of data practices through the programming pipeline which requires a rather reflective approach—of the data and programmer. That, for her, serves as one step toward Accountability. She is an executive member of DHARTI (Digital Humanities Alliance for Research and Teaching Innovations), the DH initiative in India. She has participated in conferences like DHARTI 2022, ‘Parables of AI’ by Data and Society (2021), and ‘The social life of Algorithmic Harms’ by Data and Society (2022), ADHO's DH22 to explore this approach. Her broad research interests span Ethics & Fairness in AI, Social Media, NLP and Chatbots. She graduated as a Data scientist from JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) and has an undergraduate degree in Computer Sciences from Delhi University.
